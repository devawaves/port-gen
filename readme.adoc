= Port Generator (written in Rust)

== What is this?

Portgen is a tool that takes in a string and generates a port number based on that string. This is useful for generating a port number for a service based on its name, so that the port number is deterministic and consistent across different environments.
A port number will _never_ change for a given input string, so you can be sure that the same input string will always generate the same port number.

== How To Use

If you have nix, simply run:
[source,shell]
----
nix run github:devawaves/portgen <input_string>
----

Otherwise, you can build the binary yourself by running:
[source,shell]
----
cargo build --release
./target/release/portgen <input_string>
----
